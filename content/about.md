I am a Software Developer at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), India
since 2017. I got a chance to do my internship at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), India which eventuated into a full time role.
I received my Integrated Master Degree in Mathematics and 
Computer Science from [IIT BHU](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). During final semester of
my undergrad degree I interned with [DIPAS Lab DRDO, New Delhi](https://www.drdo.gov.in/labs-and-establishments/defence-institute-physiology-allied-sciences-dipas) working on
an interesting problem on computational neuroscience involving prediction of hypoxia in soldiers located in high altitude locations.

In my leisure time I like to read latest research done in Financial time series, Markov models, and statistics in general. A copy of my CV can be found [here.]() I am currently working full time
